                            We would like to inform you that the European Directive 2002/38/EC has introduced new VAT rules involving
                            business to consumer supplies of digital services, which came into force on the 1st January 2015.
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            According to the new rules, end customers will be liable for segmented VAT rates depending on the country of their own residency, not on the country where the provider is located (as it has been until now). This change may either decrease or increase your monthly charges for our services depending on your residency.
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            For example, our customer based in Germany (VAT 19%) will be paying less than a customer in the Netherlands (VAT 21%), because of the difference in the VAT policies of those two countries.
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            This change is only applicable to all of our customers (new and existing) that are private individuals residing
                            in the EU and EU based businesses that have not provided us with a valid EU VAT ID:
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            This change does not affect:
                            – Any customers based in the Netherlands;
                            – Any EU business customers that have provided us with a valid EU VAT ID;
                            – Any customers residing outside the EU.
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            All of our customers who are affected by this change will have new invoices generated displaying the VAT rate of their member state. If you’re paying your invoices using automatic subscription payments we kindly ask you to update (cancel current subscription and create subscription with an updated amount) them accordingly to avoid unwanted service suspension.
                        </p>
                        <p class="b-news-one__item-text">
                            We kindly ask you to make sure you have your address details correct in profile so that the correct VAT can be
                            calculated: this is the law. If you require any assistance, have questions or concerns, please contact our billing department with: <a class="b-link" href="#">bill@hostkey.com</a>
